/*
Given a square matrix of size NÃ—N, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, N. The next N lines denote the matrix's rows, with each line containing N space-separated integers describing the columns.

Output Format

Print the absolute difference between the two sums of the matrix's diagonals as a single integer.

Sample Input
3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12

Sample Output
15

Explanation
The primary diagonal is:
11
      5
            -12

Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

The secondary diagonal is:
            4
      5
10
Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15
